# Cylindric Partitions and Crystal Bases

## Introduction

Cylindric partitions are a generalization of plane partitions that arise naturally
in the study of representations of affine Lie algebras. They were introduced by
Gessel and Krattenthaler in their study of cylindric plane partitions.

## Connection to Crystal Bases

The connection between cylindric partitions and crystal bases was established
through the theory of perfect crystals. Crystal bases provide a combinatorial
framework for studying representations of quantum groups.

## Generating Functions

The generating functions for cylindric partitions can be expressed in terms of
q-binomial coefficients and involve Rogers-Ramanujan type identities.
The q-binomial coefficients (also known as Gaussian polynomials) appear naturally
in this context.
