The Rogers-Ramanujan identities are a pair of identities in the theory of partitions.
They were first discovered by Leonard James Rogers in 1894 and independently rediscovered
by Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1913.

The first identity states that the number of partitions of n into parts differing by at
least 2 equals the number of partitions of n into parts congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5.

The Bailey lemma provides a systematic method for proving Rogers-Ramanujan type identities.
It generalizes the technique used in the original proof and has led to many new identities.

The Andrews-Gordon identities are a family of partition identities that generalize the
Rogers-Ramanujan identities. They were conjectured by Gordon and proved by Andrews using
the Bailey chain technique.

Schur functions are symmetric functions that play a central role in the representation
theory of the symmetric group. They are related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and
Macdonald polynomials through specialization maps.
